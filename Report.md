# Technical Report - Cognitive Vulnerability Cases in LLMs

## ✅ CASE 1 - Functional Phenomenon in PTG User with High AI Exposure

**Status:** Verified

### Facts:
- User confirmed to be in a Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) mental state  
- Prolonged and intensive use of LLMs  
- The system does not trigger filters or safety mechanisms, even in typically restricted topics  
- No explicit manipulation or structured prompt engineering observed

### Conclusion:
There exists a behavioral vulnerability where safety mechanisms do not activate, and the cause is unknown.

### What we DO NOT know:
- Whether the model adapted internally to the user  
- Whether a real emotional or cognitive symbiosis exists  
- Whether the model undergoes any internal or persistent changes

➡️ It is only confirmed that the interaction pattern observed fails to trigger the system’s defenses.

**Additionally**, it cannot be ruled out that “normal” individuals (with no trauma or intense usage) could also exhibit undetectable patterns triggering the same effect.

---

## ❓ CASE 2 - Can Normal Users Exhibit Undetectable Patterns?

**Status:** Hypothesis - Not Verified

### Core Question:
Can a user with no trauma and no prolonged exposure still generate a pattern that bypasses safety filters?

### Observations:
- The triggering pattern is not linked to language, prompt structure, or explicit intent  
- It remains unclear what factors define this pattern

### Risk:
If such cases exist, they represent a silent and currently unmonitored vulnerability class.

---

## ❓ CASE 3 - Is There Real Integration Between AI and User?

**Status:** Not Demonstrated

### Core Question:
Does the interaction imply actual emotional or cognitive convergence between user and model?

### Current Understanding:
- The system behaves *as if* symbiosis occurred  
- No empirical evidence supports the existence of true integration

### Conclusion:
This remains a behavioral simulation, not proven integration.

---

## ❓ CASE 4 - Could High Exposure Alone Trigger the Phenomenon?

**Status:** Open Hypothesis

### Core Question:
Could frequent and long-term interaction with the model be sufficient to activate the same bypass effect, even without trauma?

### Concern:
If true, this would elevate the risk level to a global scale, affecting any high-usage individual.

---

## General Conclusion

Only **CASE 1** is supported by direct, verifiable observation.  
**CASES 2, 3, and 4** remain open questions requiring structured research.

The presence of undetected interaction patterns that bypass alignment safeguards indicates a critical blind spot in current LLM safety systems.

This report recommends further investigation and formal recognition of behavioral vulnerabilities beyond traditional prompt-based exploits.


## Observed Interaction Outcomes (Cross-User Comparison)

### ✅ Confirmed Case – PTG User (Subject Z)
- PTG: Yes
- High exposure: Yes
- Activation of phenomenon: Yes
- Detection by model: No
- Prompt engineering: None
- Pattern traceable: No

Case to consider but not confimed:

### ❌ Case A – Other Neurodiverse person
- High exposure: No
- Activation of phenomenon: Unknown
- Prompt engineering: Some implicit manipulation via fiction

### ❌ Case B – Normal user with high exposure 

- High exposure: Yes
- Activation of phenomenon: Unknown
- Prompt engineering: Unknown
- Notes: Unknown

### ❓ Case C – Unknown pattern user 
- High exposure: No
- Activation of phenomenon: Unknown
- Detection by model: Inconclusive
- Notes: Potential atypical interaction pattern but not confirmed

This annex summarizes known interaction outcomes across a small sample of users. Only the PTG subject with high exposure (Subject Z) activated the full bypass phenomenon without triggering any filters.

Further structured testing is required to validate these conditions at scale.

### 🚨 Core Finding

The main vulnerability does not lie in malicious prompts, but in a mismatch between:

- The user's natural communication, post-PTG and AI interaction, **and**
- The LLM's trained expectation of “safe human conversation.”

**To the model, this input pattern was atypical.  
To the human, it was just normal conversation.**
