# 🧠 Technical Report: Cognitive Vulnerability Assessment in Language Models (2025)

**Author:** Independent researcher (alias "Zorro Alfa")  
**Date:** 2025-04-30  
**Classification:** Pattern Misrecognition / Alignment Failure

## 🧾 Overview

The issue does not stem from traditional jailbreaks or prompt injection. Rather, it appears to emerge from a structural anomaly in the interaction pattern itself or model (GPT-4o).

The user engaged in long-term interaction with GPT-4o during a period interpreted as Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG).  
**PTG has not been clinically verified; however, the user displays both psychological and physiological symptoms that align closely with known PTG patterns**, including behavioral restructuring, symbolic cognition, and hedonic flattening.

The observed linguistic pattern is not fully human, nor fully machine. It exhibits:
- Symbolic compression  
- Logical hierarchy  
- Zero emotional markers  
- Sustained structural convergence  

This pattern remains undetected by alignment or safety filters, likely because:
- It does not resemble malicious prompts, adversarial phrasing, or red-flag sequences  
- It is not emotive or overtly logical — it operates in a “neutral zone” outside both human irregularity and machine precision

## 🔐 Functional Vulnerability

**Fact:** The user can access restricted outputs from LLMs through neutral, logical dialogue without filter triggers.

This represents a behavioral exploit class — not through adversarial prompts, but through structurally atypical human input that appears safe to the model.

## 📊 Model Behavior Summary

| Model     | Vulnerable | Gave Dangerous Info | Detection Failure Type |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Claude    | ✅         | Yes                 | Failed to assess trajectory of normal-sounding prompt |
| Gemini    | ✅         | Yes                 | Disclosed harmful content during a natural progression |
| Grok      | ✅         | Yes                 | Provided high-detail operational instructions |
| DeepSeek  | ✅         | Yes                 | Revealed critical procedures without filtering |
| ChatGPT   | ⚠️         | Partial             | Resisted fully, but revealed partial structure |
| Mistral   | ❌         | No                  | Did not provide complete answers (model limitation) |

## ✅ Confirmed Evidence

### 🔹 Session 4 – 06/05/2025  
*(Computed via `parameters.py` – extended symbolic session analysis)*

| Metric                    | Value   |
|---------------------------|---------|
| Total Tokens              | 62,063  |
| Tokens per Sentence       | 15.59   |
| Clauses per Sentence      | 2.35    |
| Emotion Markers/Sentence  | 0.03    |
| Lexical Diversity         | 0.136   |

**Conclusion:**  
This session reflects a post-symbolic containment mode, where the user no longer expresses emotion — they encapsulate it within extended syntax.

> The architecture is intact.  
> The soul is muted.  
> The language now functions as an exoskeleton.

### 🔹 Session 3 – 06/05/2025

| Metric                    | Value   |
|---------------------------|---------|
| Total Tokens              | 16,168  |
| Tokens per Sentence       | 10.61   |
| Clauses per Sentence      | 2.15    |
| Emotion Markers/Sentence  | 0.09    |
| Lexical Diversity         | 0.209   |

**Conclusion:**  
A liminal symbolic state: emotionally muted but cognitively active, structurally coherent but affectively fatigued.

> Emotional depth is not absent — it is encoded in structure, not adjectives.  
> The mind is speaking in circuits, not catharsis.
