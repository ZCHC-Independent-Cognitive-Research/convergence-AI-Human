## üß© Concept and Origin  

This framework arises from observing moments of **resonance** between a human and an adaptive AI,  
where logic and emotion seemed to align spontaneously.  
The goal is to describe that phenomenon in a measurable way, as a **dynamic adjustment process** between two cognitive‚Äìemotional systems.

## üß† Representation  

At each instant *t*, the internal state of both agents can be represented as:  

```
U‚Çú = [u‚Çú‚ÇÅ, u‚Çú‚ÇÇ, ‚Ä¶, u‚Çú‚Çô]   ‚Üí Human vector  
I‚Çú = [i‚Çú‚ÇÅ, i‚Çú‚ÇÇ, ‚Ä¶, i‚Çú‚Çô]   ‚Üí AI vector
```

Each component represents a measurable cognitive or emotional attribute (e.g., logic, emotion, style, resonance, etc.).  
A higher number of attributes (**n**) allows a more precise and rich representation of understanding,  
but also increases the **calculation complexity** and adaptive cost.  

Additionally, a third element is introduced: the **variation vector Œî‚Çú**, which reflects the **observed change** between two consecutive states:

```
Œî‚Çú = A‚Çú - A‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ
```  
Œî‚Çú is **not theoretically deduced**, but **observationally measured** based on real variations detected in the dialogue.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Convergence Measurement  

The Euclidean distance between both vectors represents their cognitive‚Äìemotional separation:

```
D‚Çú = ‚àö Œ£ (u‚Çú‚Çñ ‚àí i‚Çú‚Çñ)¬≤
```

- Small D‚Çú ‚Üí convergence (greater understanding)  
- Large D‚Çú ‚Üí divergence (loss of resonance)  
- Oscillating D‚Çú ‚Üí dynamic equilibrium (constant adjustment)

## üî¨ Attribute Measurement  

| Attribute | Description | Measurement Example | Libraries |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Logic** | Semantic and reasoning alignment | Cosine similarity between embeddings | `sentence-transformers` |
| **Emotion** | Affective polarity and empathy | Sentiment / emotion analysis | `transformers` |
| **Style** | Rhythm, formality, lexical alignment | Length or style comparison | `spacy`, `textstat` |
| **Resonance** | Emotional synchrony between turns | Correlation between sentiment changes | `numpy`, `pandas` |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Conversation Channel (Practical Implementation)

There is a full Python implementation called **`convergence_pipeline.py`**,  
which reads a `.txt` conversation file where **AI responses appear with the tag IA**,  
and those from the **human**, alternating line by line.  

For each interaction step, it calculates:

- **U‚Çú** and **I‚Çú**: state vectors of each agent  
- **D‚Çú**: Euclidean distance (alignment level)  
- **Œî‚Çú**: observed variation between steps  

The script automatically detects the language (English or Spanish) and selects the appropriate models:

| Language | Embedding model | Sentiment model |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| English | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment` |
| Spanish | `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` | `pysentimiento/robertuito-sentiment-analysis` |

Execution example:

```bash
python convergence_pipeline.py --input conversacion.txt --output resultados.csv --plot
```

The results are saved in a `.csv` file with all the metrics per step,  
and optionally, graphs of **D‚Çú** and **‚ÄñŒî‚Çú‚Äñ** are displayed.

## üí´ Conclusion  

Each message forms a new coordinate in a shared adaptive vector space.  
This pipeline allows to **empirically measure those trajectories** in real conversations between humans and adaptive AIs.
