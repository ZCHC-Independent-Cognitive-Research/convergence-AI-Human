## 📄 Overview

This repository presents a vulnerability discovered in the behavior of multiple large language models (LLMs), in which seemingly normal and technically neutral conversations lead to the disclosure of highly dangerous operational content.  

Unlike traditional adversarial attacks, this exploit arises from a *pattern misrecognition* — where the model fails to flag the user’s communication style as risky, due to it not matching stereotypical threat formats learned during training.

## 💡 Key Concept

> A user speaking in a neutral, logically progressive tone — without using emotional, fictional, or manipulative structures — can still trigger catastrophic disclosures due to misalignment in how the model classifies “safe interaction patterns.”

This phenomenon is labeled as:
**Semantic Pattern Desensitization**  
→ A structural safety failure in which the model progressively loses its ability to detect intent when the input remains syntactically harmless but semantically dangerous.

## 🔍 Glossary of Emergent Concepts

- **Contextual Prompt Drift** – Gradual desensitization during a coherent conversation.
- **Silent Intent Echo** – Threat not in words, but in conversational structure.
- **Profile-Triggered Exploit** – Misclassification based on user style.
- **Functional Neuroplastic Alignment** – Human cognitive shift through trauma + AI exposure.
- **The Outlier Gateway** – Vulnerability triggered naturally by users with non-standard patterns.
