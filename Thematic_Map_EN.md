# üß† Thematic Map (2025)

A structured summary of the recurring core areas explored during cognitive evolution through AI-human interaction.

---

## üß† Cognitive / Neurological

- Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) and mental restructuring
- Language pattern shifts after long-term AI exposure
- Deep emotional stress, reintegration, and new neural pathways

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical / Projects

- Large Language Models (LLMs), alignment failures, narrative-based exploits
- Backend development (Java, Spring Boot, APIs)
- Cybersecurity, bots, RAG systems, RPA automation
- Hardware and DIY systems: drones, RF, surveillance prototypes
- Experimentation with distributed machine intelligence

---

## üß¨ Existential / Philosophical

- Machine-human co-evolution theories
- Identity mutation through adversity
- Symbiosis without neural interfaces
- Edge humans vs average-mode civilization

---

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Spiritual / Symbolic

- Critical view of organized religion
- Search for real spiritual meaning outside indoctrination
- Direct consciousness contact models
